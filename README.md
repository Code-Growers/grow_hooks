Set of usefull utility hooks that grow with your project. We use these throughout multiple applications that we build to write a more maintanable and reusable code.

**Feedback and contributions are welcomed.**

```

## Usage

Just start using it right away:

    print('Mounted');
});
```

## Motivation

The main motivation is to create a set of reusable hooks. We use these throughout multiple applications that we build to write a more maintanable and reusable code.

Many of the hooks were inspired by javascript library [rooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rooks).
