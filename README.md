# grow_hooks

Set of usefull utility hooks that grow with your project. We use these throughout multiple applications that we build to write a more maintanable and reusable code.

**All feedback is welcomed.**

## Getting started

Just add `grow_hooks` as dependency and start using it right away:

```dart
import 'package:grow_hooks/grow_hooks.dart';

useOnMount(() {
    print('Mounted');
});
```

## Motivation

The main motivation is to create a set of reusable hooks. We use these throughout multiple applications that we build to write a more maintanable and reusable code.

Many of the hook were inspired by javascript library [rooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rooks).

## Documentation

Documentation is generated by [dartdoc](https://pub.dev/packages/dartdoc) in `doc` folder.
